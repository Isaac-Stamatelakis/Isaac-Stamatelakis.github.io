## Factory Roguelite
This is a game I have been working on for about a year with a friend in animation. It's my passion project as its a mixture of two of my all time favourite games Terraria and Modded Minecraft. 

The player starts off trapped in a cave. This cave serves as their primary base but they have a powerful teleportation tool allowing them to access other caves. These caves contain materials use to upgrade their production lines and eventually unlock other caves, with the goal of eventually upgrading the teleporter enough to teleport out of the cave and return to civilization.

## Gazprea+ Compiler
The Gazprea+ compiler is designed to target MLIR-LLVM, allowing it to be compiled into various architectures such as x86, ARM, and RISC-V, among others. It is developed using the MLIR C++ API and ANTLR4 to generate a parse tree from the grammar.

Gazprea+ is a strongly typed language that includes seven data types: integers, booleans, floats, matrices, vectors, strings, and tuples. It supports functions, while loops, for loops, if/else statements, standard input and output, type casting, and more. I developed it as part of a team of four.

Additionally, I independently upgraded Gazprea to Gazprea+, adding features such as classes, structs, and pointers.
