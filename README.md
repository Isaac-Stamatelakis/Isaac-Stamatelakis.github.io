CaveTech is a long term project I've been working on for about a year with a friend in animation. It is greatly inspired by Terraria and many Minecraft Modpacks, including GregTech New Horizons, Divine Journey 2, Project Ozone 3 and more.

The player starts off trapped in a cave. This cave serves as their primary base but they have a powerful teleportation tool allowing them to access other caves. These caves contain materials use to upgrade their production lines and eventually unlock other caves, with the goal of eventually upgrading the teleporter enough to teleport out of the cave and return to civilization.

CaveTech is developed in Unity using C. All scripts and assets were developed specifically for CaveTech.
Features included:
* Item system utilizing scriptable objects. Includes many different item types, as well as a special transmutation item type which supports transmutation across states (eg iron ingot to iron plate).
* Recipe system utilizing scriptable objects. Includes 5 recipe types: standard, machine, generator, burner, and transmutation. 
* 4 different tile types: block, background, object and platform, and many tile subtypes.
* Tile entity system to add behavior to tiles placed in the world such as item storage, light sources, machines, generators, teleporters, puzzles, doors, and many more.
* 5 different types of Conduits for moving items, energy and information between tile entities.
* Customizable cave generation for creating unique caves.
* Compact Machines, a special tile entity which players can teleport into and build processing lines in. Conduits can be attached to interact between different depths. They support a recursive depth of 7. 
* Questbook that guides players through the game and is fully editable in game. Includes three quest types with rewards for completion: item retreiveal, cave dimension and checkbox.
* Many commands the player can execute through the chat.

## Gazprea Compiler 

The Gazprea compiler targets MLIR-LLVM, allowing it to be compiled into various architectures such as x86, ARM, and RISC-V, among others. The compiler is built using the C++ generating code in MLIR and uses ANTLR4 to generate a parse tree for the grammar. The Gazprea compiler was developed by myself and another student in CMPUT 415.

Gazprea is a statically typed language that includes seven data types: integers, booleans, floats, matrices, vectors, strings, and tuples. It supports functions, procedures, while loops, for loops, if/else statements, standard input, standard output, type casting, type promotion, type definitions, type qualifiers, memory management, garbage collection, and more.

## ZomCom
This game was created as a project for CMPUT 250 (Computers and Games). It was developed by me and 3 other students. I was the producer and lead programmer for the game. Although my group had unique circumstances, I'm very proud of the game we produced!

Zom com is a roguelite where players fight through rooms of zombies with their infected date with the goal of beating the final boss and curing her.
