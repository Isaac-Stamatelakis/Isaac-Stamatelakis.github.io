## Factory Roguelite
This is a game I have been working on for about a year with a friend in animation. It's my passion project as its a mixture of two of my all time favourite games Terraria and Modded Minecraft. The player starts off trapped in a cave. This cave serves as their primary base but they have a powerful teleportation tool allowing them to access other caves. These caves contain materials use to upgrade their production lines and eventually unlock other caves.

## Gazprea+ Compiler
The Gazprea+ compiler is designed to target MLIR-LLVM, allowing it to be compiled into various architectures such as x86, ARM, and RISC-V, among others. It is developed using the MLIR C++ API and ANTLR4 to generate a parse tree from the grammar.

Gazprea+ is a strongly typed language that includes seven data types: integers, booleans, floats, matrices, vectors, strings, and tuples. It supports functions, while loops, for loops, if/else statements, standard input and output, type casting, and more. I developed it as part of a team of four.

Additionally, I independently upgraded Gazprea to Gazprea+, adding features such as classes, structs, and pointers.
