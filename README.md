## Factory Roguelite
This is a game I have been working on for about a year with a friend in animation. It's my passion project as its a mixture of two of my all time favourite games Terraria and Modded Minecraft. 

The player starts off trapped in a cave. This cave serves as their primary base but they have a powerful teleportation tool allowing them to access other caves. These caves contain materials use to upgrade their production lines and eventually unlock other caves, with the goal of eventually upgrading the teleporter enough to teleport out of the cave and return to civilization.

The game is developed in Unity and includes many features:
* Item system with many item types including: crafting, tile, transmutable, conduit and more.
* Recipe system with recipe types including: item, energy, and transmutation.
* Tile system with 4 different tile types: base, background, object and platform.
* Tile entity system to add behavior to tiles placed in the world such as chests, torches, and many more.
* Conduit system with 5 different types of conduits for moving resources: Energy, item, fluid, signal and matrix.
* Cave generation system with a wide variety of generation types and decoration options
* Recursive compact machines which "shrink space" allowing players to build inside of them, and transfer materials.
* Questbook with in game editing that guides players through the game. Three different quests types: item retreiveal, cave dimension and checkbox with rewards for completion.

## Gazprea+ Compiler
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86249937-455c-4186-87d7-d94b7c5f5695" alt="GazpreaLogo+" width="200" />

The Gazprea+ compiler is designed to target MLIR-LLVM, allowing it to be compiled into various architectures such as x86, ARM, and RISC-V, among others. The compiler is built using the MLIR C++ API to generate code and ANTLR4 to generate a parse tree for the grammar. The base Gazprea compiler was developed by myself and another student in CMPUT 415.

Gazprea is a strongly typed language that includes seven data types: integers, booleans, floats, matrices, vectors, strings, and tuples. It supports functions, procedures, while loops, for loops, if/else statements, standard input, standard output, type casting, type promotion, type definitions, type qualifiers, memory management, and more.

Additionally, I independently upgraded Gazprea to Gazprea+, adding features such as classes, structs, compound assignment operations, lists, enums, and switch statements.

## ZomCom
This game was created as a project for CMPUT 250 (Computers and Games). It was developed by me and 3 other students. I was the producer and lead programmer for the game. Although my group had unique circumstances, I'm very proud of the game we produced!

Zom com is a roguelite where players fight through rooms of zombies with their infected date with the goal of beating the final boss and curing her.
